I am a Ph.D. candidate at Arizona State University. My research interests lie in the intersection of machine learning and computer vision, particularly in functional mapping and its applications in clustering, embedding learning, domain adaptation, 3D registration, and medical imaging. I am also working on unsupervised depth estimation from monocular color images. I have interned at Bosch and Intuitive Surgical. 

I am open to a full-time scientist/engineer position focusing on machine learning and computer vision, starting at Spring 2020.

I am adding contents to this new website. Meanwhile, please check my previous website at [http://www.public.asu.edu/~liangmi/](http://www.public.asu.edu/~liangmi/).
