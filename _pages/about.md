I am a computer vision engineer at Apple. I am part of the Camera Algorithms team developing new camera features for iPhones and Vision Pro. I am a main contributor to the panorama mode. 

Before joining Apple, I obtained my Ph.D degree from Arizona State University where I developed several mathematical models for solving machine learning problems, specifically matching distributional data in the Euclidean space and its applications to clustering, domain adaptation, and point-set registration.
