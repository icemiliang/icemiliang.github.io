I am a Ph.D. student at Arizona State University. My research interests lie in the intersection of machine learning and computer vision, particularly in functional mapping and its applications in clustering, domain adaptation, 3D registration, generative modeling, etc. I have interned at Bosch and Intuitive Surgical.
